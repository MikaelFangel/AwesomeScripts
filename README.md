# AwesomeScripts
This repository contain different bash scripts that solves specific task on Linux based system. They are only tested on Linux.  
Scripts will be added when I have some spare time to develop more.  

## RemoveOSXFiles.sh
The script removes MAC OS X specific files on your system, which for now is the MACOSX folder and the DS\_Store files.  
It should not be possible to run the script on MAC OS X, but this feature have not been tested and it should therefore never be run on MAC OS X as it will probably remove important files on the system.  

### Usage:  
 - p lets you define the command for where the search should start  
 - n runs the script in a dry-run mode only showing what will be removed  
 - h shows a short help manual  

The above flags can be used in combination with one an another.
